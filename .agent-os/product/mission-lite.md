# Product Mission (Lite)

OpenWarp is a free, AI-powered terminal application that helps software engineers automate command-line tasks by providing intelligent agent and plan modes, built on Microsoft Terminal's robust foundation.

OpenWarp serves software engineers and DevOps professionals who need terminal automation but can't afford premium solutions like Warp Terminal. Unlike expensive alternatives, OpenWarp provides comparable AI capabilities through OpenRouter integration while remaining completely free and open source, democratizing access to intelligent terminal automation for all developers.
