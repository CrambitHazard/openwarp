# Product Mission

## Pitch

OpenWarp is a free, AI-powered terminal application that helps software engineers automate command-line tasks by providing intelligent agent and plan modes, built on Microsoft Terminal's robust foundation.

## Users

### Primary Customers

- **Software Engineers**: Developers who want terminal automation but can't afford premium solutions like Warp Terminal
- **DevOps Engineers**: Professionals who need efficient command-line workflows with AI assistance
- **Open Source Contributors**: Developers who prefer free, community-driven tools

### User Personas

**Alex Chen** (25-35 years old)
- **Role:** Full-Stack Software Engineer
- **Context:** Works at a startup with limited budget for developer tools
- **Pain Points:** Repetitive terminal commands, complex deployment scripts, time-consuming debugging
- **Goals:** Automate routine tasks, reduce command-line errors, improve development velocity

**Sarah Johnson** (30-40 years old)
- **Role:** DevOps Engineer
- **Context:** Manages multiple cloud environments and deployment pipelines
- **Pain Points:** Complex shell scripting, environment-specific commands, manual troubleshooting
- **Goals:** Streamline deployment processes, reduce manual errors, improve system reliability

## The Problem

### Expensive Terminal Solutions

Premium AI terminals like Warp Terminal cost $20/month, putting them out of reach for many developers and small teams. This creates a barrier to accessing powerful terminal automation tools.

**Our Solution:** A completely free, open-source alternative with comparable AI capabilities.

### Manual Command Execution

Developers spend significant time typing repetitive commands, debugging shell scripts, and managing complex workflows manually. This reduces productivity and increases error rates.

**Our Solution:** AI-powered agent mode that understands natural language and executes commands automatically.

### Lack of Planning Tools

Complex tasks often require multiple steps and careful planning, but traditional terminals don't provide tools for creating and managing execution plans.

**Our Solution:** Plan mode that creates step-by-step execution strategies with user editing capabilities.

## Differentiators

### Free and Open Source

Unlike Warp Terminal's $20/month subscription, OpenWarp is completely free and open source. This democratizes AI terminal capabilities for all developers, regardless of budget constraints.

### Microsoft Terminal Foundation

Built on Microsoft Terminal's proven architecture, OpenWarp inherits its stability, performance, and extensive feature set while adding AI capabilities. This provides a more reliable foundation than custom terminal implementations.

### OpenRouter Integration

Unlike competitors tied to specific AI providers, OpenWarp uses OpenRouter for model flexibility. Users can choose from multiple AI models and switch between them based on their needs and preferences.

## Key Features
